== Requirement Class "Core"
:sectnums:

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

The Core Requirements Class of the API-Common Core Standard describes how `core` resources are accessed through an OGC conformant Web API. The requirements that make up this requirements class are grouped into two categories. <<general-requirements-section,General requirements>> are those requirements which are applicable regardless of the resource being accessed. <<resource-requirements-section,Resource requirements>> are the requirements which define the `core` resources and their applicable constraints. 

[[general-requirements-section]]
=== General Requirements

The following requirements and recommentations are applicable to all OGC Web APIs.

==== HTTP 1.1

The standards used for Web APIs are built on the HTTP protocol. Therefore, conformance with HTTP or a closely related protocol is required.

include::requirements/general/REQ_http.adoc[]

[[http-status-codes]]
==== HTTP Status Codes

<<status-codes>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be prepared to receive. This includes support for specific security schemes or URI redirection. In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

[#status-codes,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Typical HTTP status codes
[cols="15,85",options="header"]
!===
|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`302` |The target resource was found but resides temporarily under a different URI. A 302 response is not evidence that the operation has been successfully completed.
|`303` |The server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource. A 303 response is not evidence that the operation has been successfully completed.
|`304` |An <<web-caching,entity tag>> was provided in the request and the resource has not changed since the previous request.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |Content negotiation failed. For example, the `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.
!===

More specific guidance is provided for each resource, where applicable.

[[query-parameter-requirements]]
==== Unknown or invalid query parameters

If a server wants to support query parameters, these have to be explicitly declared in the API definition.

include::requirements/general/REQ_query-param-known.adoc[]

Query parameters that have not been explicitly specified in the API definition for that operation will be treated as unknown.

include::requirements/general/REQ_query-param-unknown.adoc[]

If OpenAPI is used to represent the API definition, a capability exists to define query parameters without explicitly declaring them. That is,

.OpenAPI schema for query parameters
[source,java]
----
in: query
name: queryParameters
schema:
  type: object
  additionalProperties: true
style: form
----

Note that the name of the parameter does not matter as the actual query parameters are the names of the object properties. For example, assume that the value of ``queryParameters`` is this object:

[source,java]
----
{
  "first_parameter": "some value",
  "other_parameter": 42
}
----

In the request URI this would be expressed as

[source,java]
----
{
  &first_parameter=some%20value&other_parameter=42
}
----

include::requirements/general/REQ_query-param-invalid.adoc[]

This is a general rule that applies to all parameters, whether they are specified in this document or in additional parts. A value is invalid if it violates the API definition or any other constraint for that parameter stated in a requirement.

==== Web Caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

include::recommendations/general/REC_etag.adoc[]

[[cross-origin]]
==== Support for Cross-Origin Requests

If the data is located on another host than the webpage ("same-origin policy"), access to data from a HTML page is by default prohibited for security reasons. A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from multiple distributed datasets.

include::recommendations/general/REC_cross-origin.adoc[]

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

==== Encodings

A Web API provides access to <<resource-definition,resources>> through <<representation-definition,representations>> of those resources. One property of a representation is the format used to encode it for transfer. Components negotiate which encoding format to use through the content negotiation process defined in <<rfc7231,IETF RFC 7231>>.

Additional content negotiation techniques are allowed, but support is not required of implementations conformant to this Standard.

While the OAPI Common Core standard does not specify any mandatory encoding, the following encodings are recommended:

[[rec_html]]
HTML encoding recommendation:
include::recommendations/general/REC_html.adoc[]

[[rec_json]]
JSON encoding recommndation:
include::recommendations/general/REC_json.adoc[]

[[resource-requirements-section]]
=== Resource Requirements

The `core` resources are introduced in <<core-resources-table>>. The requirements and recommendations applicable to these resources are provided in this sections below.

[#core-resources-table,reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']

|===

[[landing-page]]
==== API landing page

A Web API has a single landing page on the `{root}` node.

The purpose of the landing page is to provide clients with a starting point for using the API. It provides the basic information needed to understand the purpose, structure, and capabilities of the API. The landing page also serves as the starting point for navigation. Any resource exposed through an API can be accessed by following paths or links starting from the landing page.

===== Operation

include::requirements/core/REQ_root-op.adoc[]

===== Response

include::requirements/core/REQ_root-success.adoc[]

In addition to the required resources, links to additional resources may be included in the Landing Page.

The landing page returned by this operation is based on the following link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part1/1.0/schemas/landingPage.json[JSON schema].

.landingPage.json
[source, JSON]
include::openapi/schemas/landingPage.json[]

Examples of OGC landing pages are provided in <<landing-page-examples>>.

===== Error Situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

[[api-definition]]
==== API Definition

Every API should provide an API Definition resource which describes capabilities provided by that API. This resource can be used by developers to understand the API, by software clients to connect to the server, and by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

===== Operation

include::requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-op.adoc[]

include::recommendations/core/REC_api-definition-op.adoc[]

===== Response

include::requirements/core/REQ_api-definition-success.adoc[]

include::recommendations/core/REC_api-definition-oas.adoc[]

===== Error Situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

[[conformance-classes]]
==== Declaration of Conformance Classes

The OGC Web API Standards define a collection of modules which can be assembled into a Web API. The first question a client will ask when accessing one of these APIs is "what are you?" In other words, what modules were used to create you? Since implementors have a choice on which modules to use, there is no simple answer. The best that can be done is to provide a list of the modules implemented, the Conformance Classes.

The list of Conformance Classes is key to understanding and using an OGC Web API. So it is important that they are easy to access. A simple GET using an easily constructed URL is all that should be required. Therefore, the path to the Conformance Classes is fixed.

Ease of access is also supported by the structure of the Conformance Class resource. It is a simple list of URIs. This is a structure that requires almost no parsing and little interpretation. Designed to be accessible to even the simplest client.

===== Operation

include::requirements/core/REQ_conformance-op.adoc[]

===== Response

include::requirements/core/REQ_conformance-success.adoc[]

The conformance resource returned by this operation is based on the following link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part1/1.0/schemas/confClasses.json[Conformance Schema]. 

Examples of OGC conformance resources are provided in <<conformance-response-examples>>.
